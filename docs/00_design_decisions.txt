Design decisions:
==================

On the use of shared service to share players between components:

This currently relies on maintaining a reference to the shared array and always editing it in place.
It would be better to just make a copy of the array as we move from stage to stage.
        
An alternative: 
    Send all necessary information in the emitted event.
